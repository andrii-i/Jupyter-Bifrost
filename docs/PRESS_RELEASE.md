# Jupyter Bifrost: Interactive Data Visualization in JupyterLab

**Allows users to intuitively combine an iterative coding platform with interactive data visualizations.**

Jupyter Bifrost introduces a rapid and intuitive way to explore data! It allows users to analyze complex datasets without coding every step, instead relying on an interactive visualization interface in JupyterLab. Bifrost connects visualizations with Pandas dataframes, creating a dynamic bridge between the two.

Without interactive visualizations, exploring datasets through code can be slow and tedious. The process of writing out data transformations in code distracts the users' attention from data exploration, leading to time-consuming iterations and clogged workflows. Current visualization applications aren’t well-integrated into the notebook environment, distancing their workflows from the code’s inherent reproducibility. They also don’t keep track of micro-interactions within the user interface, requiring users to remember what changes they made to the dataset and translate them into a script in order to share with others. For serious data science projects, this translation process is a huge burden which outweighs the gains of rapid exploration.

In contrast, Jupyter Bifrost seamlessly connects the code written in JupyterLab to an interactive graphical user interface. This integration allows users to explore data at their own pace, focusing on extracting insights instead of coding repetitively. All interactions are preserved in a history log which can be conveniently extracted as a script into the notebook.

> “Jupyter Bifrost is a great way to jump into data analysis without writing a ton of code. While it's perfect for students and novices, we’ve also seen it speed up the workflows of seasoned developers. It’s easier to find interesting correlations and get into the flow of analysis. —Jupyter Developer

To get started, import the Bifrost library and plot any Pandas dataframe to begin interacting with it. Our extension will translate all of your explorations in the graphic interface into Pandas data queries, allowing you to track and reproduce your experiments with large datasets. You can also apply the results of your analysis to the original Pandas DataFrame so that you can pick up where you left off in the code. This effectively bridges the gap between graphic visualization and coding, making data analysis easier and more efficient than ever.
